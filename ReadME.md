# Bank Summary

Input bank's current balance and calculate the total balance in all banks using Python Windows Application.
The file generated will be uploaded on the Google Drive's "Balance" Folder.

If the folder is not present it will create new folder.

This program needs two files:
1. credentials.json
2. token.json

To use this code first download your own "credentials.json" file by enabling Google Drive API after signing using Google account at https://console.developers.google.com

Place the credentials.json file inside the same folder where the Bank_Summary.py file is present. Then run the code.
