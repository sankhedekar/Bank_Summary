# Bank Summary

The file generated will be uploaded on the Google Drive Balance Folder.

If the folder is not present it will create new folder.

2. token.json

To use this code first download your own "credentials.json" file by enabling Google Drive API after signing using Google account at https://console.developers.google.com

Place the credentials.json file inside the same folder where the Bank_SUmmary.py file is present.
 Then run the code.
